 * Build-time hero data for a team detail page.

 * Directus round trip. That contradicted the hybrid instant-paint contract the rest
 * of the site keeps (CLAUDE.md; /volleyball/index.astro does it properly), and it
 * cost a measured **CLS of 0.633** on /volleyball/hu20 — "poor" by Core Web Vitals
 * and by far the worst number on the site — because the hero appeared under the
 * reader once the data landed. It also meant no team page worked at all with JS off
 * or Directus down.
 *
 * `/kscw/public/team/<id>` is anonymously readable (verified), so the build can have
 * the same payload the browser gets. Only the hero fields are taken here — see the
 * note in the page templates for why the roster is deliberately NOT pre-rendered.
